#one way  a develoiper hones a model is by adding and imporving its features

#the features are represented in real-numbered vectors

#ints and floats dont need an encoding because they can be multipiled by weight

#categorical features like strings must be featured engineered to change them to numeric values

#define a mapping for categorical features. i.e. give every string a number representing that string

#if the features of categorical value has multiple values we give each feature a binary vector [length of number a features]
